Biography - Current Work
======

My usual name is **Mathieu Edouard Rebeaud** and my full name is Mathieu Marius Jean Edouard Rebeaud. I am a Swiss citizen who defended his PhD in biochemistry at the University of Lausanne in July 2022 under the supervision of **Prof. Pierre Goloubinoff.** I had the chance to work on several different topics - partly because of the **Covid-19 pandemic** - which made me leave my comfort zone, a bit by choice. 

I was then able to participate in research projects on my main subject, i.e. molecular chaperones and HSPs (heat shock proteins), as well as on Covid-19 by carrying out some meta-analyses and opinion papers. 

My main research interests are **molecular chaperones** and the study of their structure-function, as well as their **phylogenetic evolution**. The family I am most interested in at the moment is the **JDPs (J-domain proteins)** and their phenomenal increase during the evolution of species. 

I am currently working as a Scientific Collaborator in the Laboratory of Statistical Biophysics of **Prof. De Los Rios** in EPFL.
